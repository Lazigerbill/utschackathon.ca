					<h2>About the Hack</h2>

					<p>At The BRIDGE Hack, students will collaboratively develop unique ideas, designs, or solutions to sports management problems experienced by the University of Toronto Varsity Blues. Students will have the opportunity to hack on problems related to fan attendance and engagement. A variety of outcomes are acceptable, including business plans, presentations, low fidelity prototypes, data analysis or models, or web or mobile applications.</p>

					<p>The event is open to registered undergraduate and graduate students across the University of Toronto's three campuses. Participants with any level of technical expertise are welcome. You will have the opportunity to learn new skills from students in other disciplines, as well as mentors from across campus and industry.

					<h2>Prior to Hackathon</h2>

					<p>Participants will only be presented with the general theme of the hackathon at the kick-off event. The specific problems will be revealed on the day of the hack. Therefore, we suggest you do not begin to code, design elements, or draft business and marketing plans before the event. However, you can research and brainstorm ideas leading up to the event. </p>

					<p>In the week leading up to the Hackathon, teams are encouraged to complete three learning modules in order to develop their business and technical skills. The modules will focus on value propositions, market validation, and software engineering.</p>
